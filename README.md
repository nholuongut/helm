Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Use Helm to:

- Find and use [popular software packaged as Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0) to run in Kubernetes
- Share your own applications as Helm Charts
- Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
- Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
- Manage releases of Helm packages

## Helm in a Handbasket

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Install

Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/nholuongut/helm/releases/latest).

Unpack the `helm` binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!

If you want to use a package manager:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install helm`.
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) users can use `choco install kubernetes-helm`.
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can use `scoop install helm`.
- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) users can use `snap install helm --classic`.
- [Flox](https://flox.dev) users can use `flox install kubernetes-helm`.

To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the [Quick Start Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/).

See the [installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more options,
including installing pre-releases.
